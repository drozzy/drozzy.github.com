title: Better Vim Configuration

![Vimfiles Git project](../images/vimfiles.png)

Having gotten tired of constantly re-configuring my Vim on every computer, I've
decided to create a Git repository to store all the stuff. I've made it public,
available for anyone to use: [https://bitbucket.org/drozdyuk/vimfiles](https://bitbucket.org/drozdyuk/vimfiles)


What are the advantages of using Git to manage your Vim configuration?

1. Good base to start from. You don't need to fight with the ugly
   default configuration of Vim.

2. Better plugin management. By using Git, you can take advantage of Git's submodules feature, which allows 
   you to easily fetch up-to-date Vim plugins straight from their repositories.

3. Useful Plugins. My Git repository comes with a minimal number of useful
   plugins, which are tested and working. If you want you can easily add more!
