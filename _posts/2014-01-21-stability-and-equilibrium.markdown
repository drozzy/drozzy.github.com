title: Stability and Equilibrium
tags: [systems]
---

Today I would like to take a look at two concepts we use in our everyday lives: stability and equilibrium. They both describe the behavior of some *thing*. I will not use the term "system" here because it is not easily imagined. Instead, let us refer to the thing as a machine. So what does it mean for a machine to be at *equilibrium* and how does *stability* describe it's behavior?


Equilibrium
===========

Equilibrium is a state, that if entered into by a machine, will hold that machine captive there forever. In other words, if the machine is
in a state of equilibrium, then after any amount of time has passed it
will remain in the same state. If, on the other hand, a machine is
observed at a later time and found to be in a different state than
initially then we can say that that --- initial --- state is not one of
equilibrium.

What of the machine that is in a state of equilibrium, but when we
observe it tomorrow we find it to be in a different state, all because
somebody disturbed it overnight? What good is equilibrium if it can be
destroyed by anybody? Can there be machines that are harder to displace
from their equilibrium states? Think a cat or an elephant --- one will
have a hard time "disturbing" an elephant!

Stability
=========

Stability is how much disturbance can be applied to a machine such
that it will still remain in the state of equilibrium. Whether machine
is stable or not has everything to do with home much disturbance we
can send its way.

Stability is not an "absolute" concept and only makes sense when we
are talking about a machine in a state of equilibrium and a
disturbance. There is no such thing as a stable machine. When we say
that something is stable what we are in fact say is that for a given
bunch of disturbances (i.e. of some magnitude or less) the machine
will remain in its state of equilibrium. After all, even an elephant
can be moved by a big enough disturbance, for example, a tidal wave.

Conclusion
==========

While state of equilibrium is a property of the machine, it is
important to remember that stability can only be defined when given
some disturbance. Now, is an apply in a bowl at a state of
equilibrium? If so --- is it stable? What about an apple resting on
top of the upside-down coffee mug? Is it stable or not? Can the
machine that is not at equilibrium ever be stable?
