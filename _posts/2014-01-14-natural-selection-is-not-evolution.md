title: Natural Selection is not Evolution
---


What do the terms *Natural Selection* and *Evolution* mean to you? Personally, for me, I have always been put off by how often these two words are used interchangeably. Casual phrases like "evolution by natural selection" are used as if the reader is assumed to understand that evolution can proceed by some other means. But the most unfortunate part is how very few people take their time to read the original works and definitions and instead rely on the brief descriptions in a more modern work. This leads to misunderstanding and lack of common scientific language. So we end up using the terms like *Evolution* when we really mean *Natural Selection*.

In this post I am not going to define these terms. It is my belief that "defining" things never leads to any memorable understanding of the subject. Instead, I will present an interesting analogy proposed by R.S. Fisher in his monumental work entitled *The genetical theory of natural selection*, that will bring the two terms into proper relation to each other and will, hopefully, forever fix their meaning in your mind.

Analogy
=======
Fisher states the following (emphasis mine):

> To draw a physical analogy, the *laws of conduction* of heat in solids might be deduced from the *principles of statistical mechanics*, yet it would have been an unfortunate limitation, involving probably a great deal of confusion, if *statistical mechanics* had only received consideration in connexion with the *conduction of heat*. In this case it is clear that the particular physical phenomena examined are of little theoretical interest compared to the principle by which they can be elucidated.

This is an analogy to Natural Selection and Evolution, where the former is likened to the principles of statistical mechanics, while the latter - to the laws of conduction. Let us substitute these into the quote above (i.e. statistical mechanics = natural selection, laws of conduction = evolution) to get an idea of the relation between them:

> To draw a physical analogy, the *evolution* might be deduced from the *natural selection*, yet it would have been an unfortunate limitation, involving a great deal of confusion, if *natural selection* had only received consideration in connexion with the evolution. In this case it is clear that the particular physical phenomena [biological evolution] examined are of little theoretical interest compared to the principle by which they can be elucidated [natural selection].

Here we see that *Evolution* is likened to the actual physical phenomena, what is observable. Whereas *Natural Selection* is likened to the principles by which the former may be explained. When looked at these two terms this way it becomes immediately clear that *Natural Selection* is, in a sense, a more general concept --- it says "if you select something that is, in some way, better and destroy the rest, then you will end up with something that is better than before". When we take this concept and apply it to a concrete domain, like biology, we get *Evolution*. We may, however, apply it to a different domain, like computer science, and get evolution of software or computer viruses (all the while, bearing in mind that the underlying principle is that of the *Natural Selection* --- with this, confusion is minimal as to what these "complicated" things might mean).

Conclusion
==========
Sometimes, when not clear about the definition of a certain term, it helps to contrast it with another. In doing so you will often find a certain relation between the two. Just so with *Evolution*, which can be simply defined as *Natural Selection* acting in a particular real (and sometimes not) world scenario.

Lastly, I would like to recommend that you read the Preface to the Fisher's 1930 work *The genetical theory of natural selection*.
