title: Figuring out the Label and Caption in LaTeX
---

Sometimes, when you place the label and caption inside the figure out of order, you get 
weird numbering in your document when you go to reference that figure. What many people don't realize
is that there is a reason for this madness and it is much easier to understand why this happens, then
to try and remmember the order in which these things should go.

Why this happens
================

Perhaps if people know why this happens, it will be much easier to remember what goes where.

Short version
-------------

Caption command within a figure or table acts much like a sectioning command within the document. So if you don't put a caption, the label has nothing to "label", and the closest thing it can find is a section in which you are in.

Longer version
--------------

To understand what is going on we must establish a few things. First, a label command when placed anywhere in the document will label the section of the document in which it is places. So something like this:

    Section \ref{sec-one} is great!  

    \subsection{First section}
    \label{sec-one} 

    This is the first section

Will produce:

    Section 2.11 is great!

    2.11 First section
    This is the first section


Second, label command appearing in a *numbered* environment acts
differently. Numbered environments are things like equation, eqnarray,
enumerate, figure, table... In each of these environments the
label command acts differently. For example, in eqnarray
environment the label can go anywhere before the \\\\ that ends the
current equation - effectively giving each equation it's own label!

> **Remember**: A figure may have multiple captions

The figure environment has different rules. In particular, the thing
that creates numbering inside the figure environment is the caption
command. A figure may have multiple captions, creating multiple
"sections" within the figure. On other hand, if the caption command is
never used, the label still uses the text numbering (which is the
number of the section of the document it is in).

So, if we have something like:

    \begin{figure}
      BLAH
      \label{sec:one}
      \caption{Blah figure!}
      \label{fig:blah}
    \end{figure}

we now know that `Section \ref{sec:one}` will refer to the section of the document in the text (something like *Section 2.11*), while `Figure \ref{fig:blah}` will actually refer to the thing we want (something like *Figure 1*).
