title: The Relation Between Complexity and Environment

Herbert A. Simon states:

> A man, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. The apparent
> complexity of his behavior over time is largely a reflection of the
> complexity of the environment in which he finds himself.

This can be observed in everyday situations, like when you go to the
cinema. Take a look at the movie goers around you when you are in a
theater. It is quite fascinating how you can observe the plot of movie
on the faces of the audience. Similarly, in an amusement park --- once 
you are tired of a novelty of a particular ride, go on it again, and
observe those who are new to it. The excitement and the thrill of the
experience will be shown by all! Compare that with a look on your 
coworkers' faces on Monday morning. Monotone, dull.

In all the cases above people reflect the environment in which they are in. Some
environments require more complex responses, whether physical or emotional.
Others, are not tasking at all. Observe a TV-watcher (or tape yourself
staring at the screen) and decide whether it is more complex activity
then that of a first grade student working on an addition or multiplication
exercise for the first time in their life!

What would become of us if our lives would not be filled with all the
complexity that they are? Imagine a world where there is no danger, no
surprises, no reason to worry or plan ahead. In such a world, a
behavior that is most energy conserving would be just as satisfactory
as that of the most wonderful gymnast or a world leading scientist
hard at work. The nation that does least to protect itself against 
possible external disturbances would do just as well as the nation
armed to the teeth.

Consider the opposite: the world of unpredictability, danger,
dynamics, heat, cold. In a world like this a simple organism will
perish as fast as a change occurs to which it is not adapted. More complex
organisms will persevere and continue to exist. Possibly outlasting all
others.

What of the middle ground? What if the world is not fully complex nor
is it very simple and peaceful. What if, instead of being
unpredictable, the world is only partially unpredictable? What if,
instead of being dangerous, it is only dangerous sometimes? What if it
is dynamic and static at different times? What kind of organism will be
best suited to live in this world?

Clearly, an organism that is very simple will not do.  For sometimes
it will be subject to more complex disturbances than it cannot handle
and it will perish. But what of an organism that is omniscient? Will
it not be better than all others? No, because an organism that is just
complex "enough" is indistinguishable from the one that goes beyond
that. For if the environment is only as complex as the less advanced
organism, the more advanced organism cannot derive any more advantage
out of the environment than can the other, less advanced, organism.

Consider, as a way of an example, two organisms that can predict the
weather on any given day. Let's say that the first one can predict the
weather only for tomorrow, while the second one can predict the
weather for all time. Would the second one be superior to the first?
Not if survival of the organism depended only on predicting tomorrow's
weather.

In conclusion, what matters is not how complex an organism is, but how
complex it is relative to its environment. This, to me, is
fascinating!
