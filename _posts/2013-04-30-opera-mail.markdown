I'll keep this short:

- Google Reader is dead.
- Chrome does not have a built-in RSS reader.
- Opera does. It's called Opera Mail. 
- It looks like ![this](/images/operaFeeds.jpg)
- You subscribe to feeds by navigating to the RSS feed and clicking on a nice big ![subscribe button](/images/operaSubscribe.jpg)
