title: The Relation Between Complexity and Environment

Herbert A. Simon states:

> A man, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. The apparent
> complexity of his behavior over time is largely a reflection of the
> complexity of the environment in which he finds himself.

This can be observed in everyday situations, like when you go to the
cinema. Take a look at the movie goers around you when you are in a
theater. It is quite fascinating how you can observe the plot of movie
on the faces of the audience. Similarly, in a amusement park --- once 
you are tired of a novelty of a particular ride, go on it again, and
observe those who are new to it. The excitement and the thrill of the
experience will be shown by all! Compare that with a look on your 
coworker's faces on monday morning: monotone, dull, concentrated and almost
motionless.

In all cases people reflect the environment in which they are in. Some
environments require more complex responses, wether physical or emotional.
Others, are not tasking at all. Observe a TV-watcher (or tape yourself
staring at the screen) and decide whether it is more complex activity
then that of a first grade student working on a addition or multiplication
exercise for the first time in their life!

What would become of us were not our lives filled with all the
complexity that they are? Imagine a world where there is no danger, no
surprises, no reason to worry or plan ahead. In such a world, a
behaviour that is most energy conserving would be just a satisfactory
as that of the most wonderful gymnast or a world leading scientist
hard at work. The nation that does least to protect itself against 
possible external disturbances would do just as well as the nation
armed to the teeth. Less is more is really the way of the world.

Consider the opposite: the world filled with unpredictability, danger,
motion, dynamic, heat, cold. In a world like this a simple organism or
a system will perish as fast as a change occurs to which the organism
is not adapted, while a complex one will persevere and exist, possibly
out-existing all others.

What of the middle ground? What if the world is not completely complex,
i.e. there can be more complex worlds than this one. What if instead
of being unpredictable the world is only partially unpredictable? What if
instead of being dangerous is it only dangerous sometimes? What if it
is dynamic and static at different times? What kind of organism is best
to live in this world?

In this latter world we created, an organism that is very simple will
not do.  For sometimes it will be subject to more complex disturbances
than it can handle and it will perish. But what of an organism that is
omniscient? Will it not be better than all others? No, because an
organism that is just complex "enough" is indistinguishable from the
one that goes beyond that. Consider, for example, two organisms that
can predict the weather on any given day. Let's say that the first one
can predict the weath only for tomorrow, while the second one can
predict the weather for all time. Would the second one be superior than
the first? Not if survival of the organisms depended only on predicting
tomorrow's weather!

In conclusion, it is not how complex an organism is that matters, but
how complex it is relatively to the environment in which it resides. This,
to me, is fascinating!
