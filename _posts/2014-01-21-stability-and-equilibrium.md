title: Stability and Equilibrium
tags: [systems]
---

Today I would like to take a look at two concepts we use in our everyday lives&#58; stability and equilibrium. They both describe the behavior of some *thing*. I will not use the term "system" here because it is not easily imagined. Instead, let us refer to the "thing" as a *machine*. So what does it mean for a machine to be at *equilibrium* and how does *stability* describe its behavior?


# Equilibrium


Equilibrium is a state, that if entered into by a machine, will hold that machine captive there forever. In other words, if the machine is in a state of equilibrium, then after any amount of time has passed it will remain in the same state. If, on the other hand, a machine is observed at a later time and found to be in a different state than initially then we can say that that --- initial --- state is not one of
equilibrium.

What of the machine that is in a state of equilibrium, but when we observe it tomorrow we find it to be in a different state, all because somebody disturbed it overnight? What good is equilibrium if it can be destroyed by anybody? Can there be machines that are harder to displace from their equilibrium states? Think a cat or an elephant --- one will have a hard time "disturbing" an elephant!

# Stability

Stability is how much disturbance can be applied to a machine such that it will still return to the state of equilibrium. Whether machine is stable or not has everything to do with home much disturbance it can handle.

Stability is not an "absolute" concept and only makes sense when we are talking about a machine in a state of equilibrium and a given disturbance. There is no such thing as a stable machine. When we say that something is stable what we are in fact saying is that for a given disturbance (i.e. of some magnitude or less) the machine will eventually return to a state of equilibrium it was in before the disturbance was introduced. After all, even an elephant can be moved by a big enough disturbance, for example, a tidal wave.

# Conclusion

While state of equilibrium is a property of the machine, it is
important to remember that stability can only be defined only with respect to some disturbance. Now, is an apple in a bowl at a state of
equilibrium? If so --- is it stable? What about an apple resting on
top of the upside-down coffee mug? Is it stable or not? Can the
machine that is not at equilibrium ever be stable?
